# Make Change in C

This is my takehome project in its most basic form.
Once compiled, this program will take a double as an input and return change amounts using the highest denomonations of US currency.

My primary challenges in this project were: 

1: I have very, very little experience with the C language. I started with a 4 hour [YouTube tutorial](https://youtu.be/0Sg6QHmlFJE) on C for beginners to accomplish this. 

2: Dealing with decimal places in with the math aspect of makeChange. I decided to change from working in hundreths of dollars, to single pennies. I acheived this using typecasting to make the original double an int for dollars, and an int for pennies.
